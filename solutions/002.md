# [2396. Strictly Palindromic Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/strictly-palindromic-number/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

An integer n is strictly palindromic if, for every base b between 2 and n - 2 
(inclusive), the string representation of the integer n in base b is palindromic.
Given an integer n, return true if n is strictly palindromic and false otherwise.
A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: n = 9
Output: false
Explanation: In base 2: 9 = 1001 (base 2), which is palindromic.
In base 3: 9 = 100 (base 3), which is not palindromic.
Therefore, 9 is not strictly palindromic so we return false.
Note that in bases 4, 5, 6, and 7, n = 9 is also not palindromic.
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: n = 4
Output: false
Explanation: We only consider base 2: 4 = 100 (base 2), which is not palindromic.
Therefore, we return false.
```

## Constraints:

- `4 <= n <= 105`


## Solutions

### O(1) solution in Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def isStrictlyPalindromic(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return False
```

There is no such a number in `4 <= n <= 105` which will be strictly palindromic for every base `2` and `n-2`. Because any given number `n` which is larger then `4` in `n-2` base will be `12` which is not palindromic.
