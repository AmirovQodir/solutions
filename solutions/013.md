# [2520. Count the Digits That Divide a Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-digits-that-divide-a-number/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given an integer `num`, return the number of digits in `num` that divide `num`.

An integer `val` divides `nums` if `nums % val == 0`.




## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: 7 divides itself, hence the answer is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: num = 121
Output: 2
Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: num = 1248
Output: 4
Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= num <= 109`
- `num` does not contain 0 as one of its digits


## Solutions

### Simple solution

#### Python3 

```python
class Solution:
    def countDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        n = num
        while n > 0:
            current_divider = n%10
            if num%current_divider==0:
                count+=1
            n//=10
        return count
                
```
